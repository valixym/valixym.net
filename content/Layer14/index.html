Layer 14

<b>Layer 14</b> is an attempt to recreate the <a href="https://global-mind.org">Global Consciousness Project</a>, but on a much smaller scale for experimentation purposes.


<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Global Consciousness Project is an experiment that began in 1998 with the mission to prove the idea of a "global consciousness." In short, they claim that random number generators, or RNGs, may show a correlation to the human consciousness. They have RNGs, often called EGGs, across the world.
<br /><br />
There have been a handful of examples where a <i>change in randomness</i> has occurred <a href="https://global-mind.org/papers/jseNelson.pdf">during major world events</a>, further supporting their claim of a global consciousness.
<br /><br />
The purpose of <b>Layer 14</b> is to try this out for ourselves and look for a possible correlation in our own numbers. This document will work as something of a specification. This specification will be implemented carefully in a <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> program, and will be released freely under the permissive <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit/">MIT license</a>.
