<h3>pro-tips</h3>
When you see text that looks like <span class="tip" title="blah blah blah">this</span>, it's a pro-tip. It serves as a
quick note or comment on whatever text it's applied to, sorta like a footnote. All you need to do to access the
secret wisdom is to lightly hover over it. You should see a little question mark on your cursor. Brace for life-changing
information.
